# Generated Types

DO NOT EDIT THE FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY.  THEY ARE GENERATED.

This directory contains types generated by the neems-core backend.  You can
regenerate them with `dosh generate-types` if you're set up for it.

## Setup

The easiest way to do this is to have the core in a parallel directory next to
the react codebase.  I have mine set up like this:

neems
├── core
└── react

The script will find the `core` directory and handle it from there.  You can
also name it `neems-core`.  If your neems-core repo is in a different place, set
$NEEMS_CORE_DIR to the location of the repo root.  Use either an absolute
path or one relative to the root of your react repo.

You might need to set $NEEMS_TS_OUTPUT_DIR to point at src/types/generated so
the bindings end up in the right place.  The script in neems-core will try to
find the right place, but it's not very smart.
